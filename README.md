# Final project
For this task, we develop a web applicaction using the MERN stack as well as an Amazon Linux instance in the cloud that would help students to track (in a basic manner) their assignments.

## What we did?
To do so, we develop both: *backend* and *frontend* parts of the application. Particularly, for the server side we created services that would allow the correct implementation of CRUD operations on two schemas: Subjects and Activities. Furthermore, for the client side we created a very basic UI that would allow a user to interact with the CRUD.
